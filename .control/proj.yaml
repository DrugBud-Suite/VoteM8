title: VoteM8 - A Python package for consensus scoring
abstract: >-
  VoteM8 is a Python library for consensus scoring and ranking of multi-criteria data.
  It implements multiple scoring methods including ECR, RbR, TOPSIS, VIKOR and others to combine different evaluation metrics into unified rankings.
  The library supports customizable weights, handles missing values, and provides both normalization and aggregation options.
  It includes a command-line interface and can process both CSV and SDF file formats, making it particularly useful for processing molecular docking scores and other scientific data requiring consensus analysis.

  - title: Multiple Consensus Methods
    description: >-
      Implements 12 different consensus scoring methods including ECR, RbR, TOPSIS,
      VIKOR, and Pareto rankings. Each method can be used individually or combined
      for robust consensus analysis of complex datasets.
  - title: Flexible Data Processing
    description: >-
      Handles both CSV and SDF file formats with built-in missing value strategies,
      customizable weights, and normalization options. Supports aggregation methods
      and weighted criteria to adapt to different analysis needs.
  - title: Command-Line Interface
    description: >-
      Provides an intuitive CLI for rapid analysis without coding. Users can specify
      methods, columns, weights, and other parameters directly from the command line,
      making it accessible for both programmers and non-programmers.
