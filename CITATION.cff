abstract: Replace this text with a short abstract of My New Project, describing its
  purpose and main features. By default, this text is displayed on the repository's
  main README file, on the homepage of the project's website, on the project's PyPI
  and TestPyPI pages, and on the package's main docstring. Like all other entries
  in the repository's control center, this text can also contain dynamic references
  to other entries, using the <code>${â€Ž{ json-path.to.value }}$</code> syntax. By
  default, the first occurrence of the name of the project in this text is styled
  as strong and linked to the project's website.
